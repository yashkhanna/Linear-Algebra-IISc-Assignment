# Linear-Algebra-IISc-Assignment

Assignment solutions for E0 226 Linear Algebra and Probability, CSA, IISc Bangalore (Fall 2018). The list of algorithms implemented in Python3 (without using any in-built libraries) are:-

1) Gaussian Elimination for solving a system of linear equations.
2) Finding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of matrices (for applications in Spectral Clustering).
3) Gram-Scmidt orthogonalization.
4) Principal Component Analysis (for dimension reduction purposes).
